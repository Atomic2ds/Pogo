# What is this bot used for?
I run a server where people can request bots be made for them (Not massive public multipurpose all in one bots, just small playground bots) and this bot is designed to be the core utility bot for that server including tickets, rules panel, help desk, documentation, application forms and more

# Is there a configuration file?
Yes, you can edit config.py and set the env variable "TOKEN" to set the bots token but other than that most stuff is hard coded into the bot

# How long did this bot take to make?
This bot was made on December 31st 2023, right before new years. Its taken since then to get to the state its in now
